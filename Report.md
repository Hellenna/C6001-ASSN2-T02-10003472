# <span style="color:salmon"> Report For Weather Data App </span>
### GUI Programming Assignment 2 - Milestone 1 By Johnny Kingi, Taylor Inglis, Olena Skeptor and Stephen Hewlett
<br>

#### <span style="font-size:15pt; color:salmon"> Introduction </span>

This report covers the steps taken by our group to plan the development of an API (Application Programming Interface) that associates weather data with cities located using Google Maps data. &nbsp;Team roles, online resources, wireframe representations, and the 'tools' or software used in developing the API, are all discussed.

<br>

#### <span style="font-size:15pt; color:salmon"> Team Roles and Tasks </span>

The team leader for Group 2 is Johnny Kingi. &nbsp;Taylor Inglis, Olena Skeptor and Stephen Hewlett are the other members of the Group.

At our first team meeting at 10:30am on Monday, 4 September, we decided on the app we would develop. &nbsp;Olena took on the task of producing wireframes to represent the ideas sketched on paper during the meeting. &nbsp;Johnny, Stephen and Taylor committed to writing some 'user stories' to bring to class on Wednesday.

Roles were discussed further on 6 September. &nbsp;Johnny, Stephen and Taylor will work on the JavaScript and HTML coding to create twin APIs - one for the weather data and one for the map data. &nbsp;Olena displayed two wireframes she had drafted (beautiful work!!). &nbsp;The other team members contributed their thoughts and ideas on layout. &nbsp;Olena will complete the wireframes and has volunteered to do the CSS work for the API.  

Taylor and Johnny will continue doing research on API's. &nbsp;All team members have already been doing this but more needs to be done for Milestone 2. &nbsp;Stephen is working on the MarkDown report.

#### <span style="font-size:15pt; color:salmon"> Resources </span>

A number of online resources will be utilized in the operation of our app.

To obtain geographical data we will use the Google Maps APIs site. https://developers.google.com/maps

For weather data we will link to live data at the Open Weather Map site.
https://openweathermap.org/api

We expect to make use of Bootstrap to assist with formatting.

We have considered sourcing other information for users to select a <span style="color:salmon"> __MORE__ </span> option to learn about the location they have searched. &nbsp;That could mean using resources at:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page,
&nbsp;and
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Tutorial

We have viewed information on APIs available on YouTube, such as:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA, &nbsp;and the Coding Train
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r&index=5

Other API resources are available through:

#### <span style="font-size:15pt; color:salmon"> Wireframes </span>

The team agreed on 4 wireframes - a main page (or default page), one for resources, one for Help information, and one for Pop-Up information.

The wireframe for the main page contains a title, a navigation bar, two input fields for the user, and a submit button. &nbsp;There is also a Help button in the top right hand corner, and an information icon in the bottom left hand corner. &nbsp;That will lead to the resources used for creating the running the API.

The wireframes have been created in a Draw.IO file. &nbsp;The images are imported into this report via the following link:

<br>

#### <span style="font-size:15pt; color:salmon"> Tools </span>

To assist our Group with this project, we are using the following tools:
* Slack for communication
* Google Docs for textual content
* Draw.IO for diagrammatic content
* Visual Studio Code for textual content in MarkDown
* GitHub for creating and managing our repositories

We considered other tools, such as Office365, which offers MS Word and Visio. &nbsp;The team members were uncommitted to one or the other, but most were satisfied with Google Docs for ease of access. &nbsp;We also talked about using BitBucket, or GitHub. &nbsp;Again, most team members did not have a strong preference, and so we went with the team leader's preference. &nbsp;We briefly touched on other communication options before settling on Slack.
